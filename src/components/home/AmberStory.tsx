                When my son Xion was four months old, I put a little mango
                milkshake on his lips. I knew it had milk in it. I just never
                imagined he could be allergic to milk. Within minutes, rashes
                were spreading across his face and his eyes were starting to
                swell. We rushed to the ER.
              </p>
              <p className="font-semibold">
                That was the day I learned the word anaphylaxis.
              </p>
              <p>
                I built Food Allergy Certified because I couldn&rsquo;t find a
                childcare center I trusted enough for Xion. The more centers I
                visited, the more I kept seeing the same thing. Parents who knew
                everything about their child&rsquo;s allergies, and staff who had
                never been trained on any of it. That gap needed to be filled. I
                wanted to make lemonade out of lemons.
