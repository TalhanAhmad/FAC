                And when they visit your center, they&rsquo;re looking for a
                signal. Something that tells them your staff is trained,
                prepared, and ready before an incident ever happens.
              </p>
              <p>Most centers can&rsquo;t give them that signal.</p>
              <p>No certification. No badge. No visible proof.</p>

                That gap costs you enrollments. And in a worst-case scenario, it
                costs you much more.

                collaboration with pediatric allergists, emergency medicine

                Food Allergy Certified is a 90-minute certification program
                designed for childcare centers, daycares, and early education
                providers nationwide. Training incorporates evidence-based
                protocols, emergency response training, and practical
                implementation guides.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your staff gets trained. Your center gets certified. And parents
                see it the moment they walk through your door.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not just a training program. It&rsquo;s a parent trust
                system and the most visible competitive advantage your center
                can have.
