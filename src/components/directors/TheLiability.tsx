              Most childcare centers are not underprepared because they
              don&rsquo;t care. They&rsquo;re underprepared because no one has

              FAC certification changes that. Your staff learns to recognize the
              early signs of a reaction before it becomes an emergency. They
              learn when to use epinephrine, what to say to a 911 dispatcher,
              how to stay calm and keep the child calm while help is on the way.
              They learn it in language built for caregivers, not clinicians.

              When something happens, and in childcare it eventually does, the
              question is not whether your team was trained. The question is
              whether you can show that they were.
